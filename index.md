Privacy Policy for Allergen Hub

Last updated: 2026-02-12

Allergen Hub is an offline-first mobile application designed to help food businesses manage product ingredient and allergen information.

1. Data Collection

Allergen Hub does not require user accounts and does not collect personal identifiers such as names, email addresses, or phone numbers.

The app allows users to:

Capture or select images of product labels and packaging

Enter product names, ingredients, and allergen information manually

All product data, ingredient text, allergen information, and images are stored locally on the user’s device.

2. Image Processing

Images captured or selected within the app are used only for:

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract ingredient text

Optional visual reference for products and nutrition labels

OCR processing is performed entirely on-device using Google ML Kit. Images and extracted ingredient text are not transmitted to external servers.

3. Diagnostics and Analytics

To improve app reliability and performance, Allergen Hub uses:

Firebase Crashlytics (crash reporting)

Firebase Analytics (usage analytics)

These services may collect limited technical information such as:

Device type and operating system version

App version

Crash logs and performance data

Anonymous usage events

No product data, ingredient text, images, or user-entered content is transmitted via these services.

Analytics and crash reporting data are processed in accordance with Google’s privacy policies.

4. Install and Licensing Verification (Android)

On Android devices, the app may verify whether it was installed from the official Google Play Store. This check is used to protect against unauthorized redistribution.

This verification does not transmit user data or product information.

5. Data Storage

All product records, ingredients, allergen information, and images are stored locally on the device using an embedded database.

The app does not use cloud storage for product data.

6. Data Sharing

Allergen Hub does not sell, rent, or share user-entered product data with third parties.

Diagnostic and analytics data may be processed by Google Firebase for the purposes described above.

7. Data Retention and Deletion

All product data remains on the device until the user deletes it or uninstalls the app.

Uninstalling the app removes all locally stored data.

8. Permissions

The app may request access to:

Camera (to capture product images)

Photos / media (to select existing images)

Network access (for diagnostics, analytics, and licensing verification)

Permissions are used solely for core app functionality and reliability improvements.
